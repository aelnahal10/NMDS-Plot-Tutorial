# NMDS-Plot-Tutorial

Welcome to the NMDS Analysis Tutorial! This guide demonstrates how to perform a Non-Metric Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis using R. The purpose of NMDS is to represent as accurately as possible the pairwise dissimilarity between individual observations in a low-dimensional space. This tutorial provides a hands-on approach, using a simulated dataset for better comprehension.
